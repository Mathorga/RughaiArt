INVENTORY, BUFFS, REMEDIES AND TOMES

There is no magic, just technology, nature and knowledge. Buffs are mainly temporary and given by assuming a combination of crafted herbs or fruits (from now on defined as 'remedies').
There is no experience as a statistic. Instead, the character might gain permanent buffs by reading tomes.

The character may hold a fair amount of remedies in its bag, in order to use them the player must open the inventory or equip them in the belt.
The character may hold a limited amount of remedies in its belt, those will be very rapidly usable without opening the inventory.

The player will sporadically find upgrades that will allow a bigger storage of items and remedies.

Remedies are obtainable by crafting and combining naturally occurring drops such as herbs and fruits. The effect of remedies can be further increased by adding specific ingredients.
Remedies and tomes are not stackable, ingredients are stackable to a maximum of 5pcs
