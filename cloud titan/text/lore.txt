Sapiens (humans) are an ancient civilization coming from the stars. all races descend from them.
Luminata is built upon their landing site and is now just an old ruin (greek inspired).
Underneath Luminata is the wrecked ship used by the sapiens to get to the planet and one of them is still there, alive, artificially preserved in a cryogenic hibernation,
until Iryo and Aura find him and wake him up (find quest)

The hibernation state might come from a malfunction in the teleportation system.

When the sapiens approached the planet, some of them, afraid by the harsh conditions of the planet, did everything they could to hide from the surface;
they were the ancestors of the moorls, a tribe now populating the volcano.
Other sapiens desperately tried to fix the peleportation device in an attempt to get back to Earth, but failed.

The last person was dematerialized and memorized in the machine before it broke.
When Iryo and Aura get to the machine with the necessary element to fix it, they unlock it and the last person is rematerialized. (discrepancy, see line 3)

Moorls hold the key to unlock the machine and are not willing to give it to strangers, because they don't want to restore it.
Moorls see the teleport machine as devil-ish while rughai, rokor and shieva see it as a sort of salvation.
Moorls are Falmer inspired, they fight intruders on sight and are hostile.

Surface people talk about the salvation device hidden in the mountain deeps (the teleporter).
It's seen as a godly device that will bring people to heaven (Earth), depicted as made by God himself when he came to the planet.
